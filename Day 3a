Drug discovery is one of the areas where AI is having a truly transformative impact, and there are constant new developments. Here are some of the most exciting and recent trends:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n\n*   **De Novo Drug Design:** This is perhaps the hottest area. Instead of screening existing libraries, generative AI models (like GANs, VAEs, and transformer-based models) are being trained to *create* entirely new molecular structures from scratch that have desired properties (e.g., binding to a specific target, good ADMET properties - absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity).\n*   **Property Prediction and Optimization:** AI can predict various properties of a generated molecule with remarkable speed, allowing researchers to iterate quickly and refine designs. This includes predicting efficacy, toxicity, solubility, and even manufacturability.\n*   **Target-Specific Design:** AI is increasingly being used to design molecules specifically tailored to bind to particular disease targets (proteins, enzymes, etc.) with high affinity and specificity.\n\n**2. AI for Accelerating Preclinical Research:**\n\n*   **Target Identification and Validation:** AI can analyze vast biological datasets (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics) to identify novel disease targets that were previously unknown or overlooked. It can also help validate these targets by predicting their role in disease pathways.\n*   **Virtual Screening at Scale:** While not entirely new, AI has made virtual screening much more efficient. It can sift through billions of potential compounds much faster than traditional methods, identifying promising candidates for further investigation.\n*   **Predicting ADMET Properties:** AI models are becoming very good at predicting how a drug candidate will behave in the body, reducing the need for costly and time-consuming animal testing in the early stages.\n*   **In Silico Trial Simulation:** AI is starting to be used to simulate preclinical experiments, allowing researchers to test hypotheses and optimize experimental designs before starting actual lab work.\n\n**3. AI in Clinical Trial Optimization:**\n\n*   **Patient Selection and Stratification:** AI can analyze patient data to identify individuals most likely to respond to a particular drug or to identify subgroups that might benefit from specific treatments. This can lead to more efficient and successful clinical trials.\n*   **Predicting Trial Success and Failure:** AI models are being developed to predict the likelihood of a clinical trial's success based on early data, helping pharmaceutical companies allocate resources more effectively.\n*   **Identifying Optimal Dosing Regimens:** AI can analyze patient responses to different dosages to determine the most effective and safest regimen.\n\n**4. AI for Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n\n*   **Network Pharmacology and Knowledge Graphs:** AI can analyze complex biological networks and existing drug data to identify potential new uses for approved drugs, offering a faster and less risky path to new treatments.\n\n**5. Advancements in Machine Learning Techniques:**\n\n*   **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** These are particularly well-suited for analyzing molecular structures, which can be represented as graphs.\n*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Used for optimizing molecular designs through iterative processes.\n*   **Deep Learning for Complex Data:** Deep learning models are adept at learning complex patterns from diverse biological data sources.\n\n**Examples of Recent News/Developments:**\n\n*   **Companies focusing on AI-driven drug discovery:** Companies like **Recursion Pharmaceuticals**, **Atomwise**, **Exscientia**, **BenevolentAI**, and **Insilico Medicine** are making significant strides and often announce partnerships or new drug candidates moving into preclinical or clinical development.\n*   **Academic Breakthroughs:** Research papers frequently highlight novel AI algorithms or successful applications in specific disease areas (e.g., AI-designed antibiotics, AI-discovered cancer therapies).\n*   **AI-assisted drug candidates entering clinical trials:** You'll see news about drugs that were discovered or designed with the help of AI entering Phase 1, 2, or even Phase 3 trials.\n\n**Key Takeaway:** AI is not just an incremental improvement in drug discovery; it's fundamentally changing the paradigm by making the process faster, more efficient, and capable of exploring chemical spaces that were previously inaccessible. We're moving from a largely trial-and-error approach to a more intelligent, predictive, and generative one.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the second development I mentioned: **AI for Accelerating Preclinical Research**. This is a massive area, and I can elaborate on its key components:\n\nThis development encompasses how AI is being used to speed up and improve the stages of drug discovery that happen *before* human clinical trials. These preclinical stages are crucial for identifying potential drug candidates and understanding their safety and efficacy.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the sub-areas within this development:\n\n**1. Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **What it means:** Before you can design a drug, you need to know *what* to target. This involves identifying specific molecules (like proteins or genes) that are involved in a disease process. Validating a target means confirming that interfering with it will actually have a therapeutic effect.\n*   **How AI helps:**\n    *   **Analyzing Omics Data:** AI can process massive amounts of genomic, proteomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic data from healthy and diseased individuals. It can then identify subtle patterns and correlations that point to critical genes or proteins involved in disease pathways.\n    *   **Network Biology:** AI can build and analyze complex biological networks to understand how different molecules interact. This helps identify upstream or downstream targets that might be more effective or have fewer side effects than directly targeting a known molecule.\n    *   **Literature Mining:** AI-powered natural language processing (NLP) can scan millions of scientific papers to extract information about gene-disease associations, protein functions, and experimental results, accelerating the discovery of potential targets.\n    *   **Predicting Targetability:** AI can help predict whether a newly identified target is \"druggable\" – meaning a molecule can be designed to bind to it effectively.\n\n**2. Virtual Screening at Scale:**\n\n*   **What it means:** This involves sifting through vast digital libraries of chemical compounds to find those that are most likely to bind to a specific disease target. Traditionally, this was done experimentally, which is slow and expensive.\n*   **How AI helps:**\n    *   **Machine Learning Models:** AI models are trained on data from known drug-target interactions. They can then predict the binding affinity of new compounds to a target much faster than physical screening.\n    *   **Scaffold Hopping and Similarity Search:** AI can identify molecules with similar \"scaffolds\" (core chemical structures) to known drugs or compounds that bind to a target, but with variations that might improve properties or avoid patent issues.\n    *   **Ensemble Methods:** Combining predictions from multiple AI models can often lead to more robust and accurate results.\n\n**3. Predicting ADMET Properties (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity):**\n\n*   **What it means:** A compound might bind well to a target, but if it's toxic, doesn't get absorbed by the body, or is metabolized too quickly, it won't be a viable drug. ADMET properties are critical for preclinical success.\n*   **How AI helps:**\n    *   **Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) Models:** AI excels at building QSAR models that relate a molecule's chemical structure to its biological activity and ADMET properties.\n    *   **Predictive Toxicology:** AI can predict potential toxic effects of a compound on various organs or cellular systems, helping to flag problematic candidates early.\n    *   **Pharmacokinetic Modeling:** AI can help predict how a drug will be absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted over time in the body.\n\n**4. In Silico Trial Simulation & Experimental Design Optimization:**\n\n*   **What it means:** This is about using computational models to simulate biological processes or experimental outcomes.\n*   **How AI helps:**\n    *   **Predicting Experimental Outcomes:** AI can sometimes predict the likely results of certain experiments, helping researchers decide which experiments are most worth doing and how to design them for maximum information gain.\n    *   **Optimizing Reaction Conditions:** For chemical synthesis, AI can suggest optimal conditions (temperature, catalysts, solvents) to improve yields and purity.\n    *   **Robotic Automation Integration:** AI can control laboratory robots to perform experiments based on predicted optimal parameters, creating \"closed-loop\" discovery systems.\n\n**Why is this development so important?**\n\nThe preclinical phase is often a major bottleneck in drug discovery. A significant percentage of drug candidates fail at this stage due to poor efficacy, toxicity, or pharmacokinetic issues. AI is making this stage:\n\n*   **Faster:** By automating analysis and prediction.\n*   **Cheaper:** By reducing the need for extensive physical experiments and weeding out poor candidates earlier.\n*   **More Successful:** By enabling the design of better-qualified drug candidates with a higher probability of success in later stages.\n\nThis development is directly contributing to the goal of getting more effective and safer medicines to patients more quickly.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the key players in the AI-driven preclinical research space.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
